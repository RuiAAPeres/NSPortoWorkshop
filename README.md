# NSPortoWorkshop

A detailed description about a potential Workshop that could be organised in Porto, Portugal. 

## Intro

The workshop would be on a weekend and would be around 16hours. It would be around Architecture and coding best practices in **objctive-c**. The following frameworks are being considered to be used as part of the workshop (assume the use of `UIKit` and `Foundation` by default), ordered by importance:

* `Core Animation`
* `Core Location`
* `Core Data`
* `Core Graphics`

## Focus on the code

Most of our day-to-day work are mundane things: 

* Create a new class to access a service.
* Create a new `UIViewController` that displayed a given piece of information.
* Add something new to a given `UIView`.
* Fix a nasty bug on the modal layer.

These are the kind of stuff where you would mostly spend your time on. Polishing the app, creating fancy animations, custom controls are a small (**but important part**) of your work. I feel that another 16h (or potentially more) would be necessary to cover those (remember: *The devil is in the detail*). I will try to focus on the following:

* Idiomatic Objective-c code: writing code that experienced developers see and understand.
* Common patterns where/how to use them: Delegation, KVO, Notification Center, Blocks.
* Testing: because who has time for it, right?
* Architecture: both MVC and MVVM. I will try to cover them, where it makes sense, so you can have a taste of both.
* Cocoapods: this will be a small addendum but that makes our life utterly simpler.

These described above is where I will focus primarily my attention.
